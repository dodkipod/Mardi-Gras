        <article class="aabout">
          <p>
            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
            Orleans.
            Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
            Wednesday
            (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
            permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the
            last
            five
            days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding
            communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).</p>
          </p>

          The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade schedule
          and
          route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
          Knights
          of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades
          and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for
          their
          parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu
          Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into
          the
          crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw
          cups",
          Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys, but throws can also include lingerie and more sordid items. Major
          krewes
          follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

          While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans and Dauphin,
          major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and
          Canal
          Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of
          the
          Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

        <h2 class="h2m">Mayor Cantrell</h2>
        <article class="amayor">
          <p>
            LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
            Orleans,
            Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first black woman to hold the
            post.
            Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.

            Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected to by
            residents
            because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was moved to the
            downtown
            site of the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large council member
            Jason Williams to register and inspect rental units in the city.

            As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install crime cameras
            in
            her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing at
            the
            New Orleans Police Department</p>
          <p>
            Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace term-limited
            mayor
            Mitch Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell garnered the
            most
            votes, winning 39% of the total. In the November 18 runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic
            opponent Desiree Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to lead
            New
            Orleans in its 300-year history, as well as the first mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro.

            Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
            history.
            Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic
            plan
            to
            address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council tasked with
            finding
            solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for
            city
            use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public
            transportation,
            public parks, and green spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a
            lawsuit against four opioid manufactures and distributors.</p>
